 🌟 IN LOVING MEMORY OF JYOTHI MA’AM 

This project carries the name “Jyoti” for a reason far deeper than technology.
It is a tribute to our beloved Vice-Principal, Mrs. Jyothi Suresh , who passed away.
She served the school with dedication for more than two decades, touching the lives of thousands of students with her kindness, discipline, and gentle strength.

To me, she was not just an educator — she was a mother.
When I was in Class 11, she encouraged me to dream bigger and challenged our class to create something meaningful.
That moment planted the seed for this project.

Even though I could not complete my first attempt to build a WhatsApp-connected bell system while she was with us, her belief in me stayed alive.
After losing her, it took time to process the grief…
but I knew I had to finish this — for her.

This software, JOTHI, is a heartfelt dedication to her memory.
Her inspiration, guidance, and warmth will forever remain the foundation of this project.
Her loss leaves a void that can never be filled. Yet, her legacy of service, 
kindness, and integrity will forever remain in the heart of our institution. 
May her noble soul rest in eternal peace. Our heartfelt condolences go to her 
family, with prayers.


🧑‍💻 About the Developer 

I am DANIEL JENU THAYYIL , a Class 12 Computer Science student (2025-26), passionate about programming, problem-solving, and creating meaningful tools that can help others.
Developing JOTHI – Smart Bell & Assembly System has been the most challenging and rewarding project of my school life.

From learning Python in the shell to understanding APIs, PyGame, system design, and menu-driven programming — every step taught me something new.
This project is more than code… it is a promise I made, and a dream I wanted to complete.

I hope this project inspires others just like Jyoti Ma’am inspired me.

🤝 Special Thanks – Navtej

A heartfelt thank you to Navtej, my friend, who helped me in various parts of the project — troubleshooting ideas, testing modules, and supporting me during the toughest moments of development.

Your help made this journey easier, and this project carries your contribution as well.

🎓 Special Tribute – Arun Sathya Sir (Computer Science Department)

My deepest respect and gratitude to Arun Sathya Sir, my Computer Science teacher.
He taught me Python, SQL, logic building, and most importantly — how to think like a programmer.

I often asked him questions with no logic at all…
yet he never hesitated to guide me patiently.

This project would not exist without the foundation he built for me.
Thank you, sir, for believing in me, teaching me, and supporting me throughout this journey.

⭐ Closing Note

JOTHI is not just a software.
It is:

A memory

A tribute

A promise fulfilled

And a symbol of inspiration

Dedicated to an extraordinary woman,
built by a determined student,
and supported by wonderful people.

This is our story.
